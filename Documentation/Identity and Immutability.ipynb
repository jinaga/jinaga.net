    "The way that it works is that the Sequence stores a number on a hard drive. When someone asks for a number, it reads the number from the hard drive, increments it, and writes it back. It uses synchronization primitives to make sure that it only produces one number at a time. The number is stored in a location.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since the number is stored in a location -- like a hard drive or memory -- and it is used to identify a row, I call this \"location-dependent identity\". If an application wants to create a new object, it has to go to that location, and take a lock, before it can determine the new object's identity. This is a topological bottleneck in a distributed system.\n",

It's the first step to building a system that is resilient and scalable.\n",

    "Any machine is capable of generating a GUID without talking to another machine or waiting in line. And it has a really good chance of being unique. That's partly to do with its structure, but mostly to do with randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "A GUID is expressed as hexadecimal digits: 0 through f. One digit represents 4 bits of information, as 4 bits can be set in 16 different ways. A GUID has 8+4+4+4+12 = 32 digits, giving 32*4 = 128 bits of information. This is sometimes called a measure of the _entropy_ of the identifier. (Actually, a GUID has less than that because it contains a version number that takes up some of the bits. That 4 at the beginning of the third section is very predictable.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want an even better guarantee of uniqueness, then you can ask for more bits of entropy. Here's one that works pretty well. Find a random number from 0 to 2^1024-1. It takes 1024 bits to express this number. Then check to see if it is prime. If not, find a different random number. The number of primes less than N is about the square root of N, and taking the square root cuts the number of bits in half. So your 1024-bit number actually only has 512 bits of entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your 1024-bit prime, find a second one. Multiply these together to get a 2048-bit number. This number will have 1024 bits of entropy. That's a lot more than the 128 (or more like 124) bits of entropy in a GUID. Here's what a number like that looks like:"
